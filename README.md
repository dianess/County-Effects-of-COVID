In this Coconino County Task Force Project, Northern Arizona University W.A. Franke College of Business Alliance Bank Economic Policy Institute (EPI) worked with Coconino County managers, individual city managers, city economic development directors, etc. to decide on a way of analyzing the effects of COVID-19 on the county's economy.

The EPI created a survey to be sent to businesses in the county. Managers from each city sent EPI lists of business email addresses, which the survey was then sent to. EPI analyzed the data and made it available through this website.
